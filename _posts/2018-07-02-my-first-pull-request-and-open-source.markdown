For a long time now, I've been using open source software.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of proprietary software out there that is good (or great) for many uses and many people, but I like the concept of open source. You can use it for free, you can see the code, you can contribute to the project...

Wait! Why didn't I ever made a pull request to an open source project before?

I think it's because I thought I had nothing to contribute to the open source community. I don't know. That feeling that you are not good enough.

There was a time that I really liked a [project](https://github.com/FluentLayout/Cirrious.FluentLayout) , used it, and found out that it would be better to make some changes to it. [So I did](https://github.com/FluentLayout/Cirrious.FluentLayout/pull/48)!

Now, I'm no stranger to programming. But since now, I was a little bit shy of sharing something that I made, or being judged by somebody else. Again, I don't know.

What I know, is that I made a little change that can help somebody else in the future (just a tiny bit). That, for me, is the most beautiful thing about open source.
