For some time now, I can see myself writing again. Again, after more than 10 years.

So let me introduce myself. My name is Jos√© Medeiros, and I am a developer in Lisboa, Portugal.

Can you have a writer's block, for 10 years? Or is that a sign that blogosphere burst years ago and people are not so much compelled to write? I don't know. What I know, is that the medium used to share thoughts more common nowadays seems to be video (aka Youtube), and I love that, but felt the sad realization that once again the internet is becoming more wall gardened each day. So I started looking for blogs and rss readers, so that I could decentralize my reading habits, and get back to a medium that I was missing so much in my life.

Hope I can share something to the internet, once again after so many years.
